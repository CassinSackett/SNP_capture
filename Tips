Some hopefully useful tools and tips for efficient use of the pipeline:

You will get a syntax error if there are smart quotes or m dashes (like Word produces automatically) rather than straight, unformatted quotes or n dashes. You may have to edit by hand if you are copying and pasting from a Word document. It will save a lot of headaches to turn off auto-correct for these components.

ctrl u saves what you’ve typed; ctrl y pastes it

check how much space you are taking up on a drive with $ du -hs /directory/

$ ls -1 *txt | wc –l counts the number of text files in the directory. 

find a file with find /directory/ -name 'filename.ext'

the ‘$i’ links the command to the ‘i’ you gave it in the for loop; % means take i & cut off everything after the % and replace it with whatever is after the } (e.g., add a new extension to the new file)

Count the number of columns: awk '{print NF}' filename.ext | sort -nu | tail -n 1

Rename: $ for i in *.fastq; do var=‘echo $i|awk -F ‘_’ ‘{print $2 “_R1_trim.fastq”}’‘; mv $i $var; done, where the 'print $2' part tells it to print what's before the 2nd underscore. The following will give you multiple parts of the name: for i in *fastqNEW; do var=‘echo $i|awk -F ‘_’ ‘{print $1 “_” $2 “_” $3 “_” $4 “_R2_trim.fastq”}’‘; mv $i $var; done

To replace filenames/ content within a file: sed ‘s/old/new/g’ input.txt > output.txt  --e.g., for i in Honeycreeper*; do cat $i ${i/Honeycreeper/Passerines} > ${i/Honeycreeper/honeypass}; done

Calculate the mean of the values in a column: awk '{total += $3} END {print total/NR}' file

$ for i in *trim.fastq; do fastq_quality_filter -i $i -o ${i%trim.fastq}qual.fastq; done 
this replaces the trim.fastq extension with qual.fastq

NOTE: cat FileB >> FileA adds FileB to the end of FileA, but cat FileB > FileA creates a new file named FileA; so be careful not to replace an existing file.  To concatenate multiple files:   cat file1 file2 file3 > newfile, which will put them in the order in which they are typed.  

Install packages with wget package_name or yum install package_name

If samples were sequenced on multiple runs or lanes, concatenate them. If you will merge reads, make sure the concatenation is in the same order for both reads. If the replicates are in different folders, enter into one of the folders and concatenate with a loop: for i in *fastq; do cat $i ../Mayrun/$i > ../Junerun/$i; done

Replace whitespace with tab: tr " " "\t" < Expinf_spaces.txt > Expinf_tabs.txt
