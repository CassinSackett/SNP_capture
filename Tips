Some hopefully useful tools and tips for efficient use of the pipeline:

You will get a syntax error if there are smart quotes or m dashes (like Word produces automatically) rather than straight, unformatted quotes or n dashes. You may have to edit by hand if you are copying and pasting from a Word document. It will save a lot of headaches to turn off auto-correct for these components.

Useful tools and tricks:  
ctrl u saves what you’ve typed; ctrl y pastes it

check how much space you are taking up on a drive with $ du -hs /directory/

$ ls -1 *txt | wc –l counts the number of text files in the directory. 

find a file with find /directory/ -name 'filename.ext'

the ‘$i’ links the command to the ‘i’ you gave it in the for loop; % means take i & cut off everything after the % and replace it with whatever is after the } (e.g., add a new extension to the new file)

Count the number of columns: awk '{print NF}' filename.ext | sort -nu | tail -n 1

Rename: $ for i in *.fastq; do var=‘echo $i|awk -F ‘_’ ‘{print $2 “_R1_trim.fastq”}’‘; mv $i $var; done, where the 'print $2' part tells it to print what's before the 2nd underscore. The following will give you multiple parts of the name: for i in *fastqNEW; do var=‘echo $i|awk -F ‘_’ ‘{print $1 “_” $2 “_” $3 “_” $4 “_R2_trim.fastq”}’‘; mv $i $var; done

To replace filenames/ content within a file: sed ‘s/old/new/g’ input.txt > output.txt  --e.g., for i in Honeycreeper*; do cat $i ${i/Honeycreeper/Passerines} > ${i/Honeycreeper/honeypass}; done

Calculate the mean of the values in a column: awk '{total += $3} END {print total/NR}' file

$ for i in *trim.fastq; do fastq_quality_filter -i $i -o ${i%trim.fastq}qual.fastq; done 
this replaces the trim.fastq extension with qual.fastq

NOTE: cat FileB >> FileA adds FileB to the end of FileA, but cat FileB > FileA creates a new file named FileA; so be careful not to replace an existing file.  To concatenate multiple files:   cat file1 file2 file3 > newfile, which will put them in the order in which they are typed.  

Install packages with wget package_name or yum install package_name
