# SNP_capture
This repository is a self-contained SNP analysis pipeline designed for population genetic analysis of Illumina-sequenced libraries.

The 'pipeline' file contains step-by-step instructions for processing and quality-filtering reads and SNPs.  
Occasionally, Python scripts are referred to in the pipeline, and these scripts are found as stand-alone scripts in the repository.
The second portion of the 'pipeline' file includes a few options for population genetic analysis, but is of course by no means exhaustive!
